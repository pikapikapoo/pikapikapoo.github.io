><img src='/images/RDD_whether_biz_debt_binscatter.pdf'><br/>This paper studies limits on debt payment-to-income ratios that vary in how strictly they are applied in the mortgage market.  I document that, under such flexibility, a higher debt payment-to-income ratio need not imply greater default risk.  To explain this, I propose an incomplete-markets life-cycle model in which competitive lenders have discretion to relax a debt payment-to-income constraint for sufficiently creditworthy households in equilibrium.  The model accounts for observed patterns of default risk heterogeneity and highlights welfare gains from regulations that use a loan's price to proxy ability to repay instead of the debt payment-to-income ratio. <br/><img src='/images/RDD_whether_biz_debt_binscatter.pdf'>
